# SemBreaker App!

Hola Friends, it’s a common scene on the night before the examinations, we the students knock at each of our topper’s door to get his/her notes and waste a lot of our precious time in doing that. What if there is a central place where you would get all the magical notes and material to pass the papers, the destination is here, the **SemBreaker App**. Sounds fun Right ?
